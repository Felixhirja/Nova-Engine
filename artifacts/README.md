# Artifacts

This directory collects generated assets and diagnostic data that are useful for
reference but not required to build the engine.

- `screenshots/` – Captured images that illustrate different engine views and HUD states.
- `captures/` – Raw capture dumps (such as `.xwd` files and render snapshots) used for debugging.
- `diagnostics/` – Log files, profiler output, build transcripts, and other investigative reports.

Keeping these files grouped together keeps the repository root focused on the
source code while still making historical data easy to find.
