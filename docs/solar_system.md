# Solar System Overview

Our solar system consists of the Sun and the celestial bodies bound to it by gravity. This document summarizes the primary components, notable dwarf planets, and key regions of interplanetary space.

## Major Planets

| Planet | Mean Distance from Sun (AU) | Orbital Period (Earth Years) | Distinguishing Features |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Mercury | 0.39 | 0.24 | Smallest planet; heavily cratered surface; no atmosphere to speak of |
| Venus | 0.72 | 0.62 | Dense CO$_2$ atmosphere causing a runaway greenhouse effect; rotates retrograde |
| Earth | 1.00 | 1.00 | Liquid water oceans; supports a wide diversity of life; only planet with plate tectonics |
| Mars | 1.52 | 1.88 | Thin atmosphere; home to Olympus Mons and Valles Marineris |
| Jupiter | 5.20 | 11.86 | Largest planet; strong magnetic field; Great Red Spot storm |
| Saturn | 9.54 | 29.46 | Prominent ring system; low average density; numerous moons |
| Uranus | 19.19 | 84.01 | Extreme axial tilt (~98°); cold and windy atmosphere |
| Neptune | 30.07 | 164.8 | Strong winds; Great Dark Spot; active weather despite distance from the Sun |

## Dwarf Planets

Beyond the eight classical planets, several dwarf planets orbit the Sun:

- **Pluto** — Resides in the Kuiper Belt; notable for its thin nitrogen atmosphere and large moon Charon.
- **Eris** — Slightly more massive than Pluto; possesses a highly eccentric orbit reaching beyond 97 AU.
- **Haumea** — Rapidly rotating ellipsoidal body with a ring system and two known moons, Namaka and Hiʻiaka.
- **Makemake** — Bright Kuiper Belt Object with a methane-dominated surface.
- **Ceres** — Located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter; shows evidence of past cryovolcanism.

## Small Body Populations

- **Asteroid Belt** — Dense concentration of rocky bodies between Mars and Jupiter; includes large asteroids like Vesta and Pallas.
- **Kuiper Belt** — Doughnut-shaped region beyond Neptune populated with icy bodies and dwarf planets.
- **Scattered Disk** — Region of dynamically excited objects with high-eccentricity orbits extending hundreds of AU.
- **Oort Cloud** — Hypothetical spherical shell of icy bodies extending up to ~100,000 AU; believed source of long-period comets.

## Notable Moons

- **Moon (Earth)** — Stabilizes Earth's axial tilt and drives ocean tides.
- **Io (Jupiter)** — Most volcanically active body in the solar system due to tidal heating.
- **Europa (Jupiter)** — Suspected subsurface ocean beneath an icy crust; target for astrobiology missions.
- **Ganymede (Jupiter)** — Largest moon in the solar system; has its own magnetosphere.
- **Titan (Saturn)** — Thick nitrogen-rich atmosphere; surface lakes and seas of liquid hydrocarbons.
- **Enceladus (Saturn)** — Cryovolcanic jets eject water vapor and ice particles; evidence of a subsurface ocean.
- **Triton (Neptune)** — Retrograde orbit suggests captured Kuiper Belt Object; exhibits nitrogen geysers.

## Key Regions of Interplanetary Space

- **Heliosphere** — Bubble-like region dominated by the solar wind, extending beyond the orbit of Pluto.
- **Termination Shock** — Boundary where solar wind slows to subsonic speeds as it encounters the interstellar medium.
- **Heliopause** — Outer boundary of the heliosphere; marks the transition to interstellar space.
- **Magnetospheres** — Planetary magnetic fields carve out cavities in the solar wind, shielding atmospheres from charged particles.

## Exploration Highlights

- **Voyager 1 & 2** — First probes to explore the outer planets; Voyager 1 is now in interstellar space.
- **Pioneer Missions** — Early missions that paved the way for deep-space exploration and provided critical data on the outer planets.
- **Cassini-Huygens** — Studied Saturn and its moons; landed the Huygens probe on Titan.
- **New Horizons** — Conducted a flyby of Pluto and continues to explore Kuiper Belt objects.
- **Perseverance Rover** — Exploring Jezero Crater on Mars, searching for signs of past microbial life.

## Future Outlook

Upcoming missions such as Europa Clipper, JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer), and the proposed Dragonfly mission to Titan aim to deepen our understanding of the habitability of icy moons and the evolution of our solar system.
