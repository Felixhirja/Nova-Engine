# To-Do Notes

This folder gathers the engine's historical to-do notes. Each file focuses on a
specific subsystem so that follow-up work is easier to locate and track.

## Directory layout

- `docs/todo/TODO_IMPROVEMENTS.md` – consolidated backlog that previously lived in the repository root.
- `docs/todo/TODO_LIST.txt` – master checklist with cross-references into the subsystem notes below.
- `docs/todo/todo_*.txt` – focused follow-up items for individual systems such as the ECS, resource manager, rendering pipeline, and shared engine frameworks (see `todo_framework.txt`).

By keeping every legacy to-do list in one place we avoid scattering work items
across the repository and make it easier to discover related historical
context.
