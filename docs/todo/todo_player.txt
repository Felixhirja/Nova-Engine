        - [x] Support thrust mode toggle and damping via player input
        - [x] Cover jump and thrust behaviors with simulation tests
- [ ] Build locomotion state machine (idle, walk, sprint, airborne, landing) to centralize behavior blending
- [ ] Add crouch and slide movement states with camera offset adjustments
- [ ] Integrate collision response with environment geometry rather than hard-coded bounds
- [ ] Add sprint/boost mechanics tied to stamina or heat systems
- [ ] Support different movement profiles per surface (spacewalk, planetary ground, zero-G interiors)
- [ ] Implement locomotion modifiers for environmental hazards (ice, low gravity, vacuum)

### Camera & Orientation
- [ ] Synchronize player facingYaw with camera yaw when free-look disengages
- [ ] Add smooth turn-in-place animations driven by facingYaw delta thresholds
- [ ] Implement contextual camera offsets for aiming, interaction, and EVA modes

### Input & Control
- [ ] Add configurable key bindings and expose sensitivity/response tuning
- [ ] Integrate controller/gamepad support with analog axis handling
- [ ] Support input buffering for rapid direction changes and queueable actions
- [ ] Implement input context layers (on-foot, EVA, vehicle) with automatic switching
- [ ] Add accessibility options (toggle vs hold, remappable deadzones, auto-assist)
- [ ] Surface control settings via in-game UI and persist to config files

### Abilities & Interactions
- [ ] Implement player action system (interact/use, firing, contextual actions)
	- [ ] Define action state machine (idle, warm-up, executing, cooldown)
	- [ ] Map inputs to high-level actions with priority/queue rules
	- [ ] Implement interaction traces (raycast, overlap) for context detection
	- [ ] Build modular action handlers (use object, fire weapon, activate ability)
	- [ ] Add network-aware hooks for authoritative validation and replication
	- [ ] Provide animation/audio triggers tied to action lifecycle
- [ ] Connect player state to resource/health systems (health, energy, shields)
- [ ] Add inventory/equipment hooks for player stats and loadouts
- [ ] Design skill/progression tree for unlocking abilities and stat upgrades
- [ ] Implement mission scripting hooks for player-triggered events
- [ ] Add cooperative interaction mechanics (item trading, joint actions)

### Feedback & Presentation
- [ ] Drive player visual/animation states from movement (idle, walk, sprint, airborne)
- [ ] Add audio cues for footsteps, impacts, actions, and damage feedback
- [ ] Provide HUD elements for player status (health, stamina, current action)
- [ ] Implement dynamic camera shake or FOV changes tied to sprinting and damage
- [ ] Add procedural animation blending for weapon/tool usage
- [ ] Support customizable player avatars/skins with preview UI
- [ ] Introduce suit visor effects (frosting, cracks, HUD glitches) tied to environmental status

### Simulation & Systems Hooks
- [ ] Record player locomotion metrics (distance traveled, airtime, EVA duration) for analytics
- [ ] Emit gameplay events for key state changes (entering hazard, stamina exhausted, boosting)
- [ ] Integrate with telemetry/logging to visualize player state timelines during playtests

### Systems Integration & QA
- [ ] Expose player telemetry to debugging HUD/logging for diagnostics
- [ ] Write unit/integration tests for movement and bounds handling
- [ ] Document player controls and behaviors in README / design docs
- [ ] Create automated soak tests for long-duration movement and input stress cases
- [ ] Build debug tools for live tuning of player parameters during playtests
- [ ] Establish QA checklist covering single-player, multiplayer, and edge-case scenarios

### Progression & Narrative
- [ ] Define player progression milestones and reward pacing
- [ ] Connect player stats to economy and mission systems
- [ ] Implement narrative state tracking tied to player choices

### Multiplayer & Networking
- [ ] Sync player movement and actions over network with interpolation
- [ ] Handle authoritative server reconciliation for player state
- [ ] Add anti-cheat and validation hooks for player-controlled inputs

### Tooling & Mod Support
- [ ] Expose player parameters to scripting/modding APIs
- [ ] Provide editor tooling for configuring starting loadouts and spawn points
- [ ] Document best practices for modders extending player behaviors
