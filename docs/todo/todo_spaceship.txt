	- [x] Create validation diagnostics for missing/invalid components _(see `ShipAssemblyDiagnostics`)_
- [ ] Build component compatibility rules and validation
	- [x] Define slot-size/category matrices and conflict resolution _(see `SlotSizeFits` and category checks)_
	- [x] Implement runtime validator that flags invalid combinations in editor/shipyard _(assembler error reporting)_
	- [ ] Provide user-facing error messaging and auto-suggestions
- [x] Create ship performance model (mass, thrust, power draw, heat, crew requirements)
	- Completed aggregation of component contributions plus diagnostics for heat and crew utilization. See `ShipPerformanceMetrics` and new tests for coverage.

	- Implemented ShieldSystem with damage absorption, recharge mechanics, and delay timers. Added EnergyManagementSystem for power distribution across shields/weapons/thrusters with presets and diversion. Created UI design doc (`docs/energy_management_hud.md`) with keyboard controls. Backend systems complete and tested. UI rendering blocked by text rendering system.
- [ ] Create cargo management and inventory linkage for freighters
- [ ] Support passenger transport and crew management hooks
- [ ] Introduce ship progression (upgrades, unlocks, research trees)
- [ ] Add life support and environmental management loops
        - [ ] Simulate atmosphere, temperature, and radiation tolerances per compartment
        - [ ] Trigger HUD/audio alerts when life support falls outside safe ranges
