# Viewport3D Todo List

## Rendering Pipeline
- [ ] Replace legacy OpenGL immediate-mode helpers with retained-mode buffers (VAO/VBO) for cubes, HUD, and debug meshes.
- [ ] Abstract mesh building so animated sprites and 3D props share a single draw submission path.
- [ ] Profile GPU state changes during `Render` and batch entities by material/texture to cut redundant binds.

## Window & Context Management
- [ ] Add graceful fallback from fullscreen to windowed mode without recreating the GLFW context.
- [ ] Support runtime window resizing (lift `GLFW_RESIZABLE` restriction and handle `framebuffer_size` callbacks).
- [ ] Centralize SDL/GLFW context creation to eliminate duplicate init/shutdown code paths.

## Camera & Scene Visualization
- [ ] Move camera debug mesh generation out of `Init` and cache per camera profile for faster hot-reloads.
- [ ] Introduce frustum visualization and depth-grid overlays to help tune culling ranges.
- [ ] Gate expensive debug drawing behind compile-time or runtime flags to avoid release perf hits.

## UI & HUD
- [x] Replace GLUT bitmap font usage with a cross-platform text renderer (TextRenderer integration on 2025-10-10).
- [ ] Surface HUD configuration (colors, positions, metrics) via data files so designers can iterate without recompiles.
- [ ] Add proportional layout that adapts to aspect-ratio changes and ultrawide monitors.
- [ ] Swap remaining diagnostic overlays to TextRenderer widgets and remove legacy GLUT helpers.
- [ ] Provide fallback font pack detection and hot-reload toggle for HUD text assets.
- [ ] Build SVG-driven icon workflow so vector HUD assets stay crisp at any resolution (tessellate paths or generate SDFs at load time).
- [ ] Export current HUD layout to SVG for design review (include alignment guides, safe zones, and key coordinate annotations).

## Capture & Diagnostics
- [ ] Modernize `CaptureToBMP` to stream to RAM and permit user-selected output paths.
- [ ] Integrate an on-screen performance overlay (frame time, draw calls, VRAM usage) toggled from the console or UI.
- [ ] Log GL errors with source locations and provide a developer console command to dump recent events.

## Testing & Tooling
- [ ] Add headless renderer smoke test that instantiates `Viewport3D` with an off-screen context.
- [ ] Build automated screenshot comparisons for regression detection in HUD/camera visuals.
- [ ] Document Viewport3D architecture and lifecycle in the README/design docs.
