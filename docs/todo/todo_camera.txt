# Camera Todo List

## Completed
- [x] Implement target lock component for camera following
- [x] Add Tab key toggle for target lock on/off
- [x] Fix camera visual positioning to prevent blocking player view
- [x] Implement world-space camera movement with arrow keys when target lock disabled
- [x] Update HUD to show target lock status and control instructions

## Pending
- [x] Test Tab key toggle between free camera mode and target lock mode
## Pending
- [x] Verify arrow keys move camera in world space (north/south/east/west) when unlocked
- [x] Confirm WASD keys only move player, not camera
## Pending
- [x] Test smooth camera following behavior when target lock enabled
- [x] Verify camera visual offset prevents view obstruction
- [x] Test camera performance during rapid movement and following
- [x] Test edge cases: player at world boundaries, rapid Tab toggling, extreme zoom levels
- [ ] Test camera behavior with mouse look while target locked
- [x] Verify camera following works correctly when player moves in all directions
- [ ] Test camera controls with different window sizes/resolutions
- [ ] Add camera control documentation to README
- [x] Consider adding camera presets or bookmarks for common positions
- [ ] Test camera system integration with other game systems (physics, rendering)
- [ ] Add camera shake effect for impacts/explosions
- [ ] Implement camera collision detection to prevent going through walls

## Recent Improvements (Completed)
- [x] Add config-driven camera tuning (shoulder offset, pitch bias, sensitivities)
- [x] Implement angle-based near-vertical yaw stabilization
- [x] Add runtime config validation to prevent bad hot-loads
- [x] Add math helpers (ExpAlpha, SmoothStep, DegToRad/RadToDeg) for consistency
- [x] Add compile-time asserts for default value sanity checks
- [x] Implement exponential smoothing for frame-rate independence
- [x] Add shortest-arc yaw blending to avoid wrap glitches
- [x] Add configurable pitch clamping with safe bounds
- [x] Add delta-time clamping for stability in variable framerates

## Future Enhancements
- [x] Implement soft ground clamp with spring-based easing (use groundClampHz config)
- [x] Add obstacle avoidance: raycast from player to desired camera position, push forward on hit (placeholder - needs physics raycast API)
- [x] Implement dynamic shoulder offset based on target screen position
- [ ] Add adaptive smoothing: increase rotResponsiveness when target is moving fast
- [ ] Add camera shake effects for impacts/explosions with configurable intensity/duration
- [ ] Implement camera bookmarks/presets system with save/load functionality
- [ ] Add cinematic camera paths for scripted sequences
- [ ] Implement camera occlusion fade-out for objects between camera and target
- [ ] Add camera auto-framing for multiple targets (e.g., fleet view)
- [ ] Implement camera prediction for high-velocity targets to reduce lag
