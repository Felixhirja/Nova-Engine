# Nova-Engine — TODO Checklist (quick-hit)

*Snapshot of actionable items pulled from the roadmap. Use this to drive daily execution.*

## Next 48 Hours

* [ ] GLFW context: switch to OpenGL 4.6 Core + fallback chain; verify init.
* [ ] Add GLAD loader; call `gladLoadGLLoader` and log success/failure.
* [ ] XInput: delay-load + version probe (1_4 → 1_3 → 9_1_0); graceful no‑gamepad path.
* [ ] Startup graphics dump: vendor/renderer/version/extensions → `graphics_info.log`.
* [ ] Cross‑platform `clean` target (PowerShell + Bash) and test on Windows.
* [ ] DLL checker/copy PowerShell script wired before run.
* [x] SVGSurfaceLoader: integrate FreeType text rasterization + font asset packaging.
* [ ] SVGSurfaceLoader: software filter stack with `feGaussianBlur` support for HUD art.
## Next 7 Days

* [ ] ECS V2: archetype transition copy fix + fuzz tests; run under ASAN/UBSAN; determinism check.
* [ ] Headless harness: scripted input playback, JSON state snapshots, perf CSV exporter.
* [ ] CI matrix: Windows (MSVC, MinGW) + Ubuntu (clang/gcc) with cache; artifacts zipped.
* [ ] clang-format/clang-tidy config + pre-commit; CI gates with autofix in PRs.
* [ ] Crash handling: integrate Crashpad/Breakpad + symbol upload pipeline.
* [ ] Settings schema (JSON/TOML) with versioning + **Safe Mode** boot flag.

## Next 14 Days

* [ ] OpenGL debug context + `KHR_debug` callback; on-screen toast in dev builds.
* [ ] Shader hot-reload with fallback to last good binary on error.
* [ ] GPU timer queries per pass (opaque/transparent/post/UI) → CSV export.
* [ ] Frustum culling prototype (bounding spheres + coarse BVH); FPS delta recorded.
* [ ] HDR spike: ACES tonemapping; screenshot diffs vs LDR baseline.
* [ ] Floating-origin / camera-relative rendering prototype to reduce precision jitter.
* [x] SVGSurfaceLoader: integrate FreeType text rasterization + font asset packaging.
* [ ] SVGSurfaceLoader: software filter stack with `feGaussianBlur` support for HUD art.

## Accessibility & UX

* [ ] Reduced‑motion preset (disable camera bob/shake; cap FOV change rate).
* [ ] Input toggles vs hold; remappable stick dead zones.

## Solar System & Precision

* [ ] Elliptical orbits (Kepler elements) with mean anomaly update.
* [ ] Hierarchical reference frames (planet‑centric) to avoid double‑precision.
* [ ] Time scaling controls (pause/slow/fast) with stable integrator bounds.

## Networking Readiness

* [ ] Deterministic tick runner (fixed dt) + command recording for future rollback.
* [ ] Snapshot & delta serialization stubs (opt‑in per component).
* [ ] Interest management filter draft (proximity/visibility).

## Packaging & Docs

* [ ] First‑run hardware/driver probe; save checklist to file.
* [ ] License audit of third‑party code; auto‑generate `NOTICE`.
* [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` + issue/PR templates and coding standards.
* [ ] High‑level architecture diagram (C4 L2) + hot‑path sequence diagrams.

## QA & Performance

* [ ] Golden‑image tests (offscreen FBO diff) running in CI with artifact uploads.
* [ ] 8‑hour headless soak test with memory/leak watch and periodic snapshots.
* [ ] Perf budgets per frame (ms targets per subsystem) with CI regression assertions.
* [ ] Automated worst‑case scene builder (many ships/particles) for stress testing.
