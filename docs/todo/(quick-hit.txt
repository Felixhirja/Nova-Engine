# Nova-Engine — TODO Checklist (quick-hit)

*Snapshot of actionable items pulled from the roadmap. Use this to drive daily execution.*

## Next 48 Hours

* [x] GLFW context: switch to OpenGL 4.6 Core + fallback chain; verify init.
* [x] Add GLAD loader; call `gladLoadGLLoader` and log success/failure.
* [x] XInput: delay-load + version probe (1_4 → 1_3 → 9_1_0); graceful no‑gamepad path.
* [x] Startup graphics dump: vendor/renderer/version/extensions → `graphics_info.log`.
* [x] Cross‑platform `clean` target (PowerShell + Bash) and test on Windows.
* [x] DLL checker/copy PowerShell script wired before run.
* [x] SVGSurfaceLoader: integrate FreeType text rasterization + font asset packaging.
* [x] SVGSurfaceLoader: software filter stack with `feGaussianBlur` support for HUD art.
* [ ] Viewport3D: add regression checks for entity mesh overrides and ASCII fallback rendering.
* [ ] Viewport3D: capture fresh viewport screenshots for docs after GL context upgrades.
## Next 7 Days

* [x] ECS V2: archetype transition copy fix + fuzz tests; run under ASAN/UBSAN; determinism check.
* [x] Headless harness: scripted input playback, JSON state snapshots, perf CSV exporter.
* [x] CI matrix: Windows (MSVC, MinGW) + Ubuntu (clang/gcc) with cache; artifacts zipped.
* [x] clang-format/clang-tidy config + pre-commit; CI gates with autofix in PRs.
* [x] Crash handling: integrate Crashpad/Breakpad + symbol upload pipeline.
* [x] Settings schema (JSON/TOML) with versioning + **Safe Mode** boot flag.
* [x] Viewport3D: instrument per-view render timing and stream to diagnostics overlay.
* [x] Viewport layout editor prototype with live hot-reloadable JSON configs.

## Next 14 Days

* [x] OpenGL debug context + `KHR_debug` callback; on-screen toast in dev builds.
* [x] Shader hot-reload with fallback to last good binary on error.
* [x] GPU timer queries per pass (opaque/transparent/post/UI) → CSV export.
* [x] Frustum culling prototype (bounding spheres + coarse BVH); FPS delta recorded.
* [x] HDR spike: ACES tonemapping; screenshot diffs vs LDR baseline.
* [x] Floating-origin / camera-relative rendering prototype to reduce precision jitter.
* [x] SVGSurfaceLoader: integrate FreeType text rasterization + font asset packaging.
* [x] SVGSurfaceLoader: software filter stack with `feGaussianBlur` support for HUD art.
* [ ] Viewport3D: multi-monitor spanning experiment with DPI-aware letterboxing.

## Accessibility & UX

* [x] Reduced‑motion preset (disable camera bob/shake; cap FOV change rate).
* [x] Input toggles vs hold; remappable stick dead zones.

## Solar System & Precision

* [x] Elliptical orbits (Kepler elements) with mean anomaly update.
* [x] Hierarchical reference frames (planet‑centric) to avoid double‑precision.
* [x] Time scaling controls (pause/slow/fast) with stable integrator bounds.

## Networking Readiness

* [x] Deterministic tick runner (fixed dt) + command recording for future rollback.
* [x] Snapshot & delta serialization stubs (opt‑in per component).
* [x] Interest management filter draft (proximity/visibility).

## Packaging & Docs

* [x] First‑run hardware/driver probe; save checklist to file.
* [x] License audit of third‑party code; auto‑generate `NOTICE`.
* [x] `CONTRIBUTING.md` + issue/PR templates and coding standards.
* [x] High‑level architecture diagram (C4 L2) + hot‑path sequence diagrams.

## QA & Performance

* [x] Golden‑image tests (offscreen FBO diff) running in CI with artifact uploads.
* [x] 8‑hour headless soak test with memory/leak watch and periodic snapshots.
* [x] Perf budgets per frame (ms targets per subsystem) with CI regression assertions.
* [x] Automated worst‑case scene builder (many ships/particles) for stress testing.
