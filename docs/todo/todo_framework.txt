# Engine Framework TODOs

## Engine Bootstrap & Lifecycle
- [ ] Document the initialization order inside `engine/EngineBootstrap.cpp` and expose a checklist for mandatory subsystems (input, audio, rendering) so new frameworks can hook in without breaking startup assumptions.
- [ ] Add shutdown/teardown pathways to `EngineBootstrap` that call into `ResourceManager`, `AudioSystem`, and ECS cleanup helpers to avoid leaks when running automated harnesses.
- [ ] Introduce a bootstrap configuration asset (JSON/TOML) that declares which frameworks load on startup so experiments can toggle systems without recompiling.

## Frame Scheduling & Timing
- [ ] Extend `engine/FrameScheduler.cpp` to surface per-stage timing (input, simulation, render prep, present) and store rolling averages for HUD display.
- [ ] Wire the scheduler metrics into `FramePacingController` so VSync/offline frame pacing choices are data-driven instead of hardcoded constants.
- [ ] Provide a headless mode flag that skips rendering work but keeps simulation ticking for automated soak tests.

## System Manager & Scheduler Integration
- [ ] Flesh out `SystemManager` so systems register their dependencies and update phases, then feed that graph into `SystemSchedulerV2` for consistent execution ordering.
- [ ] Emit diagnostic warnings when two systems declare conflicting read/write access to the same component sets to help teams debug framework collisions.
- [ ] Mirror the dependency metadata into `engine/docs` so designers can review which frameworks are mandatory per gameplay feature.

## Resource & Asset Frameworks
- [ ] Audit `ResourceManager.cpp` load paths to ensure async streaming hooks call back on the main thread before touching OpenGL objects.
- [ ] Add telemetry for asset cache hits/misses and expose a debug HUD overlay to monitor streaming health during playtests.
- [ ] Build a smoke test that iterates every entry in `assets/` and validates the loader registered for that resource type, logging missing frameworks.

## Diagnostics & Tooling
- [ ] Create a developer console command that prints the active framework list (audio, UI batching, physics, etc.) along with initialization success/failure state.
- [ ] Capture framework init/shutdown events in the existing logging system with timestamps so QA can correlate failures with runtime telemetry.
- [ ] Generate a markdown status report under `artifacts/framework_status.md` during CI that summarizes enabled frameworks and outstanding warnings.

## Documentation
- [ ] Update `docs/engine_overview.md` (create if missing) with a section per framework describing ownership, key headers, and extension hooks.
- [ ] Author quick-start snippets showing how to register a new framework subsystem and plug it into the bootstrap + scheduler pipeline.
- [ ] Cross-link the new documentation from `README.md` and the relevant subsystem quickstart guides so contributors can find framework guidance quickly.
