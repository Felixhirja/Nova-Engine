# Resource Manager Todo List

## Asset Lifecycle & Caching
- [ ] Separate logical handles from file paths so streaming assets can be reloaded without invalidating IDs.
- [ ] Add reference counting and automatic release of unused surfaces/textures.
- [ ] Support asynchronous loading (worker thread + futures) to prevent main thread stalls.
- [ ] Track asset memory footprint and expose debug counters to the HUD/console.

## Format & Platform Support
- [ ] Replace BMP-only loading with stb_image or SDL_image for PNG/JPEG/TGA support and alpha handling.
- [ ] Allow asset packages/virtual file systems so resources can be shipped in archives.
- [ ] Introduce platform abstraction so non-SDL builds can still load textures/meshes (e.g., raw pixel buffers).
- [ ] Add SVG ingestion path that tessellates vector paths into renderable meshes or signed-distance textures for HUD usage.
- [x] Provide configurable rasterization of SVG icons for fallback bitmap atlases (export multiple DPI targets automatically).
      `LoadSVGSurface` now accepts rasterization options (width/height/scale) so
      tools can emit multiple DPI variants directly from the engine code.

## Metadata & Sprites
- [ ] Persist sprite metadata to external JSON/YAML so artists can tweak frame sizes/fps without recompiles.
- [ ] Validate sprite registration against loaded assets (matching dimensions, frame counts).
- [ ] Add animation set definitions (idle, walk, attack) that map to frame ranges.

## Error Handling & Diagnostics
- [ ] Centralize logging with error codes when loads fail; surface fallback visuals instead of returning null.
- [ ] Implement hot-reload notifications so other systems can respond when assets change at runtime.
- [ ] Write automated tests that simulate missing/corrupt files and ensure graceful recovery.

## Tooling & Documentation
- [ ] Document resource handle lifecycle, ownership model, and thread-safety guarantees.
- [ ] Provide a CLI or editor utility to pre-cache assets and generate metadata bundles.
- [ ] Integrate with future scripting/mod APIs to allow dynamic resource injection.
